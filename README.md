# Keyed-Shaft-Solid-Surrogate-Model-Generation-Tool
Generates a solid surrogate FE model of a keyed shaft in Abaqus for the ShapeShift framework. Automates geometry, material assignment, meshing and torsional loading to enable faster, lower-cost analysis compared to filament-level models while maintaining useful accuracy.
